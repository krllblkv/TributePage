<h2>Ecology and behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diet</strong> - They feed primarily on grasses and small seeds</li>
<li><strong>Habitat and burrowing</strong> - live mainly at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 ft above sea level</li>
<li><strong>Social organization and spacing</strong> - highly social animals</li>
<li><strong>Reproduction and parenting</strong> - copulation occurs in the burrows, which reduces the risk of interruption by a competing male</li>
<li><strong>Anti-predator calls</strong> - well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators from a great distance</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  In companies that use large numbers of cubicles in a common space, employees sometimes use the term "prairie dogging" to refer to the action of several people simultaneously looking over the walls of their cubicles in response to a noise or other distraction
